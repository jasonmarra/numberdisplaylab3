6.when calling increment on minutes, i count everytime i click until 60 then it will roll over to 0.after that when u call increment on the hours object to make the clock advance by 1 hour.
8.When you setValue to a number higher than the limit,when calling getValue, it enters the last number that was entered that was lower than the limit.
10."Error:non static method getValue()cannot be referenced from a static context"
11."Error: '.class'expected".Including an "int" in the parameter was incorrect.once we do include it,we are creating a variable which doesnt work here.
13. 0 is the value, because once we replace">=" with ">", if ever the replacementValue is equal to 0, it wont set the value field.
14.negative values and values higher than the limit would now be possible so you can input.
15.false and (34!=33) && ! false are true.
16.(a==b)
17.(a!=b)
18.No it doesnt work for all circumstances.
